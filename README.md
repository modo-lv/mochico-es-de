# Mochico (EmulationStation Desktop Edition theme)

## Overview

Mochico is a custom theme for [EmulationStation Desktop Edition (ES-DE)](https://es-de.org), made for handheld screens, with a focus on colorful minimalism and simplicity.

It combines the design of "Colorful (Flat)" system selection view from [NSO Menu (Interpreted)](https://github.com/anthonycaccese/nso-menu-interpreted-es-de/tree/main) with a game selection screen based heavily on [Chicuelo Revisited](https://github.com/anthonycaccese/chicuelo-revisited-es-de).

Made for and tested with 16:10 and 16:9 screen ratios.

### Features & screenshots
* A system selection screen that showcases the gorgeous Colorful hardware images:

* Dark mode for use at night, dimms both colors and images:
